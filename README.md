# RecursionError in Python

This repository demonstrates a common error in Python involving recursive functions: exceeding the maximum recursion depth.  The provided code shows a function that, given large inputs, causes a `RecursionError` because the recursion never ends.

The solution file provides a way to solve this by introducing memoization to avoid redundant calculations and avoid stack overflow issues.
